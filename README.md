## ✅ Benefits of VPNs

- Masks your true IP and physical location.
- Encrypts all internet traffic, protecting data on public Wi-Fi.
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and censorship.
- Enhances online privacy by preventing ISPs or attackers from tracking your activities.

---

## ❌ Limitations of VPNs

- Free plans often have limited server choices and slower speeds due to congestion.
- VPN providers can technically log user data if not trustworthy.
- VPNs alone do not ensure complete anonymity — browser tracking and cookies may still identify users.
- Some online services block VPN traffic to enforce regional restrictions.

---

## 🔎 Browser Extension Check

- Reviewed all installed browser extensions.
- No suspicious or unknown extensions were found.
- Unused extensions were removed as a security precaution.

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Successfully configured and tested ProtonVPN.
- Verified that the VPN effectively changes the public IP and encrypts network traffic.
- Understood VPN encryption, protocols, privacy policies, and practical limitations.
- Conducted a browser extension review for additional security hygiene.
